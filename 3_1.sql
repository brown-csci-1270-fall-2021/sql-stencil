Write a SQL query that finds primary_title, avg_rating and 
reviews of 20 movies. The reviews depend on average rating. 
A movie with rating less than or equal to 3 should be reviewed as ‘poor’. 
A movie with rating greater than 3 and less than or equal to 6 should be 
reviewed as ‘okay’ and a movie with rating greater than 6 should 
be reviewed as ‘good’. 
The result should be sorted by the title (descending order)

(Hint: The CASE function may come in handy)
